In order to model the influence of actor behaviour we have developed {ACT} (Agent-Based Model of Critical Transitions), an agent-based model inspired by an existing conceptualisation of critical transitions. {ACT} allows us to depart from the current mean-field approach and explicitly explore the effects of heterogeneity, leaders, and networks on the transition. Two key finding are (1) the importance of local communities and (2) leaders can both encourage and discourage the energy transition; a finding that nuances existing literature on critical transitions. We conclude with a reflection on the strengths and weaknesses of our modeling approach.},

This regime shift comprises several transformations, which are currently altering the technological, political and economic system structure. To build my argument, I first sketch how technological, political and economic developments reduced the resilience of the conventional fossil-nuclear energy regime and created a new {RES}-regime. Second, I depict recent changes in German public discourse and energy policy as the shift to the {RES}-regime. Third, I highlight the challenges involved with increasing the resilience of the {RES}-regime. In particular, sufficient resilience of the electricity transmission grid appears to be crucial for facilitating the transformation of the whole energy system.},

Voters who perceive the economy as weak indeed punish governing parties more severely when they associate them with environmental policies; conversely, a green reputation when the economy is expanding garners left-wing parties higher vote probabilities. Right-wing governing parties fare similarly, benefitting from those who perceive them as green when the economy is hale, albeit only converging to the vote probabilities awarded from voters who see them as less green when the economy sours.},

Researchers have also explored the intricate dynamics of social phenomena such as polarization, the spiral of silence, and pluralistic ignorance. Pluralistic ignorance is a condition when the real opinion in a society is different from the spoken ideas. It is not clear how a difference in opinions between what someone says publicly (expressed opinion) and what they truly think (private opinion) arises, spreads, and continues to exist over time. To better understand this phenomenon, an Expressed-Private Opinion model was used to analyze how this discrepancy changes over time, using agent-based modeling. The study categorized agent types into four groups based on parameters, followed by an analysis of a society in which these types of agents are connected. It has demonstrated that individuals holding majority opinions are susceptible to being influenced by the minority. This susceptibility arises from social pressure, which can lead people to conceal their true opinion and conform to the assumed majority opinion. In certain societies, individuals are less likely to conform to the minority opinion when they receive early support or encounter voices that uphold their own opinions.},

They offer a more realistic description of micro behavior than traditional climate policy models by allowing for agent heterogeneity, bounded rationality and nonmarket interactions over social networks. This enables the analysis of a broader spectrum of policies. Here, we review 61 {ABM} studies addressing climate-energy policy aimed at emissions reduction, product and technology diffusion, and energy conservation. This covers a broad set of instruments of climate policy, ranging from carbon taxation, and emissions trading through adoption subsidies to information provision tools such as smart meters and eco-labels. Our treatment pays specific attention to behavioral assumptions and the structure of social networks. We offer suggestions for future research with {ABMs} to answer neglected policy questions.

	abstract = {The world is grappling with emerging, urgent, large-scale problems, such as climate change, pollution, biodiversity loss, and pandemics, which demand immediate and coordinated action. Social processes like conformity and social norms can either help maintain behaviors (e.g. cooperation in groups) or drive rapid societal change (e.g. rapid rooftop solar uptake), even without comprehensive policy measures. While the role of individual heterogeneity in such processes is well studied, there is limited work on the expression of individuals’ preferences and the role of anticonformists—individuals who value acting differently from others—especially in dynamic environments. We introduce anticonformists into a game-theoretical collective decision-making framework that includes a complex network of agents with heterogeneous preferences about two alternative options. We study how anticonformists’ presence changes the population’s ability to express evolving personal preferences. We find that anticonformists facilitate the expression of preferences, even when they diverge from prevailing norms, breaking the “spiral of silence” whereby individuals do not act on their preferences when they believe others disapprove. Centrally placed anticonformists reduce by five-fold the number of anticonformists needed for a population to express its preferences. In dynamic environments where a previously unpopular choice becomes preferred, anticonformists catalyze social tipping and reduce the “cultural lag,” even beyond the role of committed minorities—that is, individuals with a commitment to a specific cause. This research highlights the role of dissenting voices in shaping collective behavior, including their potential to catalyze the adoption of new technologies as they become favorable and to enrich democracy by facilitating the expression of views.},

	abstract = {The modelling of deceptions in game theory and decision theory has not been well studied, despite the increasing importance of this problem in social media, public discourse, and organisational management. This paper presents an improved formulation of the extant information-theoretic models of deceptions, a framework for incorporating these models of deception into game and decision theoretic models of deception, and applies these models and this framework in an agent based evolutionary simulation that models two very common deception types employed in “fake news” attacks. The simulation results for both deception types modelled show, as observed empirically in many social systems subjected to “fake news” attacks, that even a very small population of deceivers that transiently invades a much larger population of non-deceiving agents can strongly alter the equilibrium behaviour of the population in favour of agents playing an always defect strategy. The results also show that the ability of a population of deceivers to establish itself or remain present in a population is highly sensitive to the cost of the deception, as this cost reduces the fitness of deceiving agents when competing against non-deceiving agents. Diffusion behaviours observed for agents exploiting the deception producing false beliefs are very close to empirically observed behaviours in social media, when fitted to epidemiological models. We thus demonstrate, using the improved formulation of the information-theoretic models of deception, that agent based evolutionary simulations employing the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma can accurately capture the behaviours of a population subject to deception attacks introducing uncertainty and false perceptions, and show that information-theoretic models of deception have practical applications beyond trivial taxonomical analysis.},

	abstract = {This thesis investigates the phenomenon of pluralistic ignorance, clears up some conceptual confusion regarding its definition, and explores ethical problems connected to it. A primary contribution lies in the development of an agent-based computer simulation of pluralistic ignorance. Observations of this simulation lead to tentative recommendations about how to deal with pluralistic ignorance in social networks.
Pluralistic ignorance involves a systemic discrepancy between individuals' private and publicly stated beliefs. This happens because individuals mistakenly perceive widespread acceptance of a proposition within their social group. This leads them to conceal their sincere beliefs and to conform to the perceived majority belief in public. Since everyone does so, it looks like the whole society accepts a certain proposition, when in fact no one (or almost no one) does.
Through agent-based simulations, this thesis investigates interventions to dispel pluralistic ignorance. It explores the impact of introducing into pluralistically ignorant social networks invariably-sincere agents (sincerians) and contrarians, revealing their potential to change the behavior of insincere agents and, under certain conditions, help others to share their beliefs sincerely.},

Traditional models, based on opinion dynamics with private and public states, fail to account for a key aspect: when nonexpression aligns with normative behavior, initial social pressure can induce pluralistic ignorance. We show that pluralistic ignorance persists under infrequent imitation and strong initial minority influence. Although individuals can overcome this ignorance by the end of interactions, it reemerges in subsequent meetings. However, excessive imitation erases pluralistic ignorance, leading to a uniform state in which internal and external states align. Furthermore, incorporating memory into the internalization process shows that pluralistic ignorance peaks at moderate imitation levels.},

	abstract = {We introduce an integrated approach, blending Opinion Dynamics with a Macroeconomic Agent-Based Model ({OD}-{MABM}) to explore the co-evolution of climate change mitigation policy and public support. The {OD}-{MABM} links a novel opinion dynamics model that is calibrated for European countries using survey data to the Dystopian Schumpeter meeting Keynes model ({DSK}). Opinion dynamics regarding climate policy arise from complex interactions among social, political, economic and climate systems where a household’s opinion is affected by individual economic conditions, perception of climate change, industry-led (dis-)information and social influence. We examine 133 policy pathways in the {EU}, integrating various carbon tax schemes and revenue recycling mechanisms. Our findings reveal that effective carbon tax policies initially lead to a decline in public support due to substantial macroeconomic transition costs, threatening political feasibility. However, they also pave the way for a positive social tipping point in the future. This shift stems from the evolving economic and political influence associated with the fossil fuel-based industry, which gradually diminishes as the transition unfolds. Second, hybrid revenue recycling strategies that combine green subsidies with climate dividends successfully address this intertemporal trade-off in our model by accelerating the transition and mitigating its economic fallout, thus broadening public support.},

	abstract = {Representing human decisions is of fundamental importance in agent-based models. However, the rationale for choosing a particular human decision model is often not sufficiently empirically or theoretically substantiated in the model documentation. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare models because the model descriptions are often incomplete, not transparent and difficult to understand. Therefore, we expand and refine the ‘{ODD}’ (Overview, Design Concepts and Details) protocol to establish a standard for describing {ABMs} that includes human decision-making ({ODD} + D). Because the {ODD} protocol originates mainly from an ecological perspective, some adaptations are necessary to better capture human decision-making. We extended and rearranged the design concepts and related guiding questions to differentiate and describe decision-making, adaptation and learning of the agents in a comprehensive and clearly structured way. The {ODD} + D protocol also incorporates a section on ‘Theoretical and Empirical Background’ to encourage model designs and model assumptions that are more closely related to theory. The application of the {ODD} + D protocol is illustrated with a description of a social–ecological {ABM} on water use. Although the {ODD} + D protocol was developed on the basis of example implementations within the socio-ecological scientific community, we believe that the {ODD} + D protocol may prove helpful for describing {ABMs} in general when human decisions are included.},

Failure to cooperate in the provision or preservation of these goods is fundamental to sustainability challenges, ranging from local fisheries to global climate change. In the real world, such cooperative dilemmas occur in multiple interactions with complex strategic interests and frequently without full information. We argue that voluntary cooperation enabled across overlapping coalitions (akin to polycentricity) not only facilitates a higher generation of non-excludable public goods, but it may also allow evolution toward a more cooperative, stable, and inclusive approach to governance. Contrary to any previous study, we show that these merits of multi-coalition governance are far more general than the singular examples occurring in the literature, and they are robust under diverse conditions of excludability, congestion of the non-excludable public good, and arbitrary shapes of the return-to-contribution function. We first confirm the intuition that a single coalition without enforcement and with players pursuing their self-interest without knowledge of returns to contribution is prone to cooperative failure. Next, we demonstrate that the same pessimistic model but with a multi-coalition structure of governance experiences relatively higher cooperation by enabling recognition of marginal gains of cooperation in the game at stake. In the absence of enforcement, public-goods regimes that evolve through a proliferation of voluntary cooperative forums can maintain and increase cooperation more successfully than singular, inclusive regimes.},

This leads to a system of two difference equations, where the first one corresponds to the standard {FJ} model, except that the influence matrix is no longer constant, and the second one models the dynamics of this matrix. We show that a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of this modified version of the classical {FJ} model is that the influence matrix becomes constant in a finite number of steps. Moreover, we provide the explicit expression for the agents’ asymptotic opinions in some special cases: the purely cooperative setting, the case of a structurally balanced network and the case of a single discussion topic.

	abstract = {Significance
            Classical game theory addresses how individuals make decisions given suitable incentives, for example, whether to use a commons rapaciously or with restraint. However, classical game theory does not typically address the consequences of individual actions that reshape the environment over the long term. Here, we propose a unified approach to analyze and understand the coupled evolution of strategies and the environment. We revisit the originating tragedy of the commons example and evaluate how overuse of a commons resource changes incentives for future action. In doing so, we identify an oscillatory tragedy of the commons in which the system cycles between deplete and replete environments and cooperation and defection behavior, highlighting new challenges for control and influence of feedback-evolving games.
          , 
            A tragedy of the commons occurs when individuals take actions to maximize their payoffs even as their combined payoff is less than the global maximum had the players coordinated. The originating example is that of overgrazing of common pasture lands. In game-theoretic treatments of this example, there is rarely consideration of how individual behavior subsequently modifies the commons and associated payoffs. Here, we generalize evolutionary game theory by proposing a class of replicator dynamics with feedback-evolving games in which environment-dependent payoffs and strategies coevolve. We initially apply our formulation to a system in which the payoffs favor unilateral defection and cooperation, given replete and depleted environments, respectively. Using this approach, we identify and characterize a class of dynamics: an oscillatory tragedy of the commons in which the system cycles between deplete and replete environmental states and cooperation and defection behavior states. We generalize the approach to consider outcomes given all possible rational choices of individual behavior in the depleted state when defection is favored in the replete state. In so doing, we find that incentivizing cooperation when others defect in the depleted state is necessary to avert the tragedy of the commons. In closing, we propose directions for the study of control and influence in games in which individual actions exert a substantive effect on the environmental state.},

We identify payoff-dependent transition rules that lead to oscillatory {TOCs} in stochastic simulations and the mean field limit. Further extending the stochastic model, we find that spatially explicit interactions can lead to emergent, localized dynamics, including the propagation of cooperative wave fronts and cluster formation of both social context and resources.

	abstract = {The evolution of opinions in the long-standing debate on growth-versus-environment may affect support for important sustainability policies, in areas such as biodiversity loss, climate change, deforestation and freshwater scarcity. In order to understand this evolution, we develop a model describing the dynamics of four distinct opinions as identified in recent surveys, namely growth-at-all-cost, green growth, agrowth and degrowth. The model is based on modifying standard replicator dynamics to match a multi-group structure. Individuals are influenced by local or global interactions with others, based on adjacent opinion groups and exposure to information about environmental change. Psychological resistance to opinion change is also accounted for. The model is calibrated with recent survey data. Numerical analysis shows which opinions survive under particular conditions. We find, among others, that under local interactions, ultimate outcomes are characterized by lack of consensus, i.e. survival of multiple opinions. In addition, equal impacts of environmental change on opinions do not always translate in joint survival of associated opinions. Under worsening environmental conditions while continuing economic growth, opinions shift from green growth to agrowth and degrowth. Fostering global interactions among individuals, causing them to be influenced by a broad spectrum of opinions, makes consensus more likely. We also consider model dynamics if feedback from opinions to policy to environmental change and back is included. This confirms robustness of the results. It should be noted that the model is not meant to predict but to explore the consequences of combinations of assumptions about social networks, psychological mechanisms, environmental dynamics, and connections between opinion distribution and environmental policy. The study represents the first analysis of opinion dynamics in the growth-vs-environment debate and suggests a number of routes for further investigation.},

If opinions have no intrinsic value, and acquire their value when held by the majority of individuals in a discussion group, then we have a situation that can be modeled as an N-player game. Here we explore the dynamics of (binary) opinion formation using a game-theoretic framework to study an N-player game version of Galam’s local majority-vote model. The opinion dynamics is modeled by a stochastic imitation dynamics in which the individuals copy the opinion of more successful peers. In the infinite population limit, this dynamics is described by the classical replicator equation of evolutionary game theory. The equilibrium solution shows a threshold separating the initial frequencies that lead to the fixation of one opinion or the other. A comparison with Galam’s deterministic model reveals contrasting results, especially in the presence of inflexible individuals, who never change their opinions. In particular, the N-player game predicts a polarized equilibrium consisting only of extremists. Using finite-size scaling analysis, we evaluate the critical exponents that determine the population size dependence of the opinion’s fixation probability and mean fixation times near the threshold. The results underscore the usefulness of combining evolutionary game theory with opinion dynamics and the importance of statistical physics tools to summarize the results of Monte Carlo simulations.},

	abstract = {Strategic interactions arise in all domains of life. This form of competition often plays out in dynamically changing environments. The strategies employed in a population may alter the state of the environment, which may in turn feedback to change the incentive structure of strategic interactions. Feedbacks between strategies and the environment are common in social-ecological systems, evolutionary-ecological systems, and even psychological-economic systems. Here we develop a framework of ‘eco-evolutionary game theory’ that enables the study of strategic and environmental dynamics with feedbacks. We consider environments governed either by intrinsic growth, decay, or tipping points. We show how the joint dynamics of strategies and the environment depend on the incentives for individuals to lead or follow behavioral changes, and on the relative speed of environmental versus strategic change. Our analysis unites dynamical phenomena that occur in settings as diverse as human decision-making, plant nutrient acquisition, and resource harvesting. We discuss implications in fields ranging from ecology to economics.},

	abstract = {Considering feedback of collective actions of cooperation on common resources has vital importance to reach sustainability. But such efforts may have not immediate consequence on the state of environment and it is unclear how they influence the strategic and environmental dynamics with feedbacks. To address this issue, we construct a feedback-evolving game model in which we consider the growth capacity of resources and the punishment efficiency on defectors who do not provide returns to the environment. Importantly, we further assume a delay in adopting the contribution of cooperative individuals to environmental change in our model. We find that when this contribution amount from cooperators’ endowment is fixed, the time delay has no particular consequence on the coevolutionary dynamics. However, when the return is proportional to their endowment, then the time delay can induce periodic oscillatory dynamics of cooperation level and environment. Our work reveals the potential effects of time delay of cooperative actions on the coevolutionary dynamics in strategic interactions with environmental feedback.

	abstract = {Climate change and technological advances are reshaping ecosystems and societies. Strategic choices that were best yesterday may be sub-optimal tomorrow; and environmental conditions that were once taken for granted may soon cease to exist. In dynamic settings, how people choose behavioral strategies has important consequences for environmental dynamics. Economic and evolutionary theories make similar predictions for strategic behavior in a static environment, even though one approach assumes perfect rationality and the other assumes no cognition whatsoever; but predictions differ in a dynamic environment. Here we explore a middle ground between economic rationality and evolutionary myopia. Starting from a population of myopic agents, we study the evolutionary viability of a new type that forms environmental forecasts when making strategic decisions. We show that forecasting types can have an advantage in changing environments, even when the act of forecasting is costly. Forecasting types can invade but rarely overtake the population, producing a stable coexistence with myopic types. Moreover, forecasting fosters collective intelligence by providing a public good which reduces the amplitude of environmental oscillations and often increases mean payoffs to forecasting and myopic types alike. We interpret our results for understanding the evolution of different modes of decision-making such as forecasting. And we discuss implications for the management of environmental systems of societal importance.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic carbon emissions have the potential to trigger changes in climate and ecosystems that would be catastrophic for the well-being of humans and other species. Widespread shifts in production and consumption patterns are urgently needed to address climate change. Although transnational agreements and national policy are necessary for a transition to a fully decarbonized global economy, fluctuating political priorities and lobbying by vested interests have slowed these efforts. Against this backdrop, bottom-up pressure from social movements and shifting social norms may offer a complementary path to a more sustainable economy. Furthermore, norm change may be an important component of decarbonization policies by accelerating or strengthening the impacts of other demand-side measures. Individual actions and policy support are social processes?they are intimately linked to expectations about the actions and beliefs of others. Although prevailing social norms often reinforce the status quo and unsustainable development pathways, social dynamics can also create widespread and rapid shifts in cultural values and practices, including increasing pressure on politicians to enact ambitious policy. We synthesize literature on social-norm influence, measurement, and change from the perspectives of psychology, anthropology, sociology, and economics. We discuss the opportunities and challenges for the use of social-norm and social-tipping interventions to promote climate action. Social-norm interventions aimed at addressing climate change or other social dilemmas are promising but no panacea. They require in-depth contextual knowledge, ethical consideration, and situation-specific tailoring and testing to understand whether they can be effectively implemented at scale. Our review aims to provide practitioners with insights and tools to reflect on the promises and pitfalls of such interventions in diverse contexts.},

	shorttitle = {Opinion dynamics},
	abstract = {Recently, social phenomena have received a lot of attention not only from social scientists, but also from physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists, in the emerging interdisciplinary field of complex system science. Opinion dynamics is one of the processes studied, since opinions are the drivers of human behaviour, and play a crucial role in many global challenges that our complex world and societies are facing: global financial crises, global pandemics, growth of cities, urbanisation and migration patterns, and last but not least important, climate change and environmental sustainability and protection. Opinion formation is a complex process affected by the interplay of different elements, including the individual predisposition, the influence of positive and negative peer interaction (social networks playing a crucial role in this respect), the information each individual is exposed to, and many others. Several models inspired from those in use in physics have been developed to encompass many of these elements, and to allow for the identification of the mechanisms involved in the opinion formation process and the understanding of their role, with the practical aim of simulating opinion formation and spreading under various conditions. These modelling schemes range from binary simple models such as the voter model, to multi-dimensional continuous approaches. Here, we provide a review of recent methods, focusing on models employing both peer interaction and external information, and emphasising the role that less studied mechanisms, such as disagreement, has in driving the opinion dynamics.

	abstract = {Human and environmental systems are often treated as existing in isolation from one another, whereas in fact they are often two parts of a single, coupled human-environment system. Developing theoretical models of coupled human-environment systems is a continuing area of research, although relatively few of these models are based on differential equations. Here we develop a simple differential equation coupled human-environment system model of forest growth dynamics and conservationist opinion dynamics in a human population. The model assumes logistic growth and harvesting in the forest. Opinion spread in the human population is based on the interplay between conservation values stimulated by forest rarity, and injunctive social norms that tend to support population conformity. We find that injunctive social norms drive the system to the boundaries of phase space, whereas rarity-based conservation priorities drive the system to the interior. The result is complex dynamics including limit cycles and alternative stable states that do not occur if injunctive social norms are absent. We found that the model with injunctive social norms had five possible observable outcomes, whereas the model without social norms had only two stable states. Thus social norms and have dramatic influence in conservation dynamics. We also find that increasing the conservation value of forests is the best way to boost and stabilize forest cover while also boosting conservationist opinion in the population, although for some parameter regimes it can also give rise to long-term oscillations in opinions and forest cover. We conclude that simple models can provide insights and reveal patterns that might be difficult to see with high-dimensional computational models, and therefore should be used more often in research on coupled human-environment systems.},

However, the socio-politico-technical processes that will determine climate policy and emissions trajectories are treated as exogenous in almost all climate change modelling3,4. Here we identify relevant feedback processes documented across a range of disciplines and connect them in a stylized model of the climate–social system. An analysis of model behaviour reveals the potential for nonlinearities and tipping points that are particularly associated with connections across the individual, community, national and global scales represented. These connections can be decisive for determining policy and emissions outcomes. After partly constraining the model parameter space using observations, we simulate 100,000 possible future policy and emissions trajectories. These fall into 5 clusters with warming in 2100 ranging between 1.8 °C and 3.6 °C above the 1880–1910 average. Public perceptions of climate change, the future cost and effectiveness of mitigation technologies, and the responsiveness of political institutions emerge as important in explaining variation in emissions pathways and therefore the constraints on warming over the twenty-first century.},

Our coupled climate and social model resulted in a global temperature change ranging from 3.4–6.2 °C by 2100 compared with 4.9 °C for the C-{ROADS} model alone, and led to behavioural uncertainty that was of a similar magnitude to physical uncertainty (2.8 °C versus 3.5 °C). Model components with the largest influence on temperature were the functional form of response to extreme events, interaction of perceived behavioural control with perceived social norms, and behaviours leading to sustained emissions reductions.

This study provides a systematic review of empirical studies that consider social equality in access to climate change adaptation and mitigation initiatives. Our findings show that in the last decade, research has tended to focus on international income inequalities and climate injustice while few studies have considered inequalities in access to mitigation and adaptation initiatives at the neighbourhood or city level. Also largely absent from the reviewed research, were studies focused on vulnerabilities other than economic disadvantage, such as immigrant status, language barriers or physical disabilities.

	abstract = {This study aims to develop the concept of self-social engineering in the context of tourism, focusing on tourists’ pro-environmental behavior. By integrating psychological theories such as Environmental Psychology Theory, the Theory of Planned Behavior, and Norm Activation Theory, the purpose of the investigation was to determine the extent of the direct influence of independent variables of perceived environmental quality ({PEQ}), attitude, subjective norm ({SN}), and perceived behavioral control ({PBC}) on self-social engineering ({SSE}) and their indirect influence through intention to engage in environmentally responsible behavior ({ERB}). The structural analysis results from a sample of 191 visitors indicated that the unified model demonstrates a satisfactory predictive capability for {SSE}. This study’s findings highlight significant and insignificant relationships among the research variables, providing insights into the dynamics of pro-environmental behavior. Significant positive relationships were observed between attitude and {SSE} and between {SN} and {SSE}, demonstrating the influence of individual attitudes and social pressures on fostering self-initiated environmental actions. Similarly, {PBC} was found to significantly impact both {SSE} and {ERB}, indicating that individuals who feel capable of taking environmental actions are more likely to do so. Conversely, some relationships were found to be insignificant. The relationship between {PEQ} and {SSE} was insignificant, suggesting that positive perceptions of environmental quality alone may not motivate individuals to engage in self-directed environmental behaviors. Additionally, {PEQ} showed a negative relationship with {ERB}, indicating that high environmental quality perceptions might reduce the urgency to act, potentially leading to complacency. These findings highlight pro-environmental behavior’s complex and context-dependent characteristics, underscoring the importance of adopting integrated approaches considering individual and situational factors. The limitations of this study include its cross-sectional design, which restricts the ability to analyze behavioral changes over time. Additionally, its relatively localized sample does not fully capture broader tourist populations’ diverse demographic and geographical contexts.},

Decision-making regarding climate collective action includes individuals' perceptions of the anticipated future existential risks of the climate crisis (risk of inaction) and present-day political risks of climate activism (risk of action). Our research, spanning four studies (two correlational surveys and two pre-registered experiments), focused on climate activism in Germany (N = 1027). We consistently showed that heightened politicized activist identification was associated with both confrontational and non-confrontational climate collective action across four studies. Furthermore, the anticipated existential climate risk was associated with non-confrontational climate action and present-day political risk with confrontational action. Politicized climate identity remained a robust predictor across different action tactics, while the content and temporality of risk (future existential vs. present-day political) in one's environment determined the transition between engagement in confrontational and non-confrontational climate action dynamically. Nevertheless, we did not find causal links between risk perceptions and collective action. We discuss our findings in line with {ESIM} (Elaborated Social Identity Model), and potential explanations for the lack of causal relationship and future directions for alternative methodologies and comprehensive conceptualization of risk perceptions are suggested.},

Based on cognitive hierarchy theory, the present study aims to investigate the factors that motivate or hinder young people’s perception of forestation as a strategy to mitigate climate change in post-conflict Somalia. This study hypothesized a model in which climate change knowledge, risk perception and forest value orientations (anthropocentric/biocentric) influence attitude toward forestation and attitude, in turn, predicts behavioral intentions. We randomly surveyed students from three universities in three different regions of Somalia and collected 434 structured survey questionnaires. Using structural equation modeling, the results showed that climate change knowledge is a significant predictor of behavioral intention but not attitude toward forestation. The results also revealed that young people’s perception toward forestation as a strategy to mitigate climate change is significantly influenced by biocentric value orientation both directly and indirectly through attitude toward forestation. Contrary to previous studies, our results indicate that attitude partially mediates the relationship between biocentric value orientation and behavioral intentions and fully mediates the relationship between anthropocentric value orientation, risk perception and behavioral intentions, while it did not show any mediation results between climate change knowledge and behavioral intention. We found that the young people’s climate action or inaction is mainly shaped by climate change knowledge, biocentric value orientation, and attitude toward forestation. Finally, climate change mitigation efforts should avoid relying solely on attitude for behavioral decision-making formation and instead incorporate other factors into a more comprehensive framework.},

	abstract = {A recent surge of research has investigated the potential of pro-environmental behavior interventions to affect other pro-environmental behaviors not initially targeted by the intervention. The evidence evaluating these spillover effects has been mixed, with some studies finding evidence for positive spillover (i.e., one pro-environmental behavior increases the likelihood of performing additional pro-environmental behaviors) and others finding negative spillover (i.e., one pro-environmental behavior decreases the likelihood of additional pro-environmental behaviors). Different academic disciplines have investigated this question, employing different methodologies and arriving at divergent findings. This paper provides a unifying theoretical framework and uses the framework to review the existing research on pro-environmental behavior spillover. Our framework identifies different decision modes as competing mechanisms that drive adoption of initial pro-environmental behaviors, with different consequences for subsequent pro-environmental behaviors, leading to positive, negative, or no spillover. Attribution of the initial pro-environmental behavior to either an external motivator (e.g., a price signal) or internal motivator (e.g., self-identity) also matters. In addition, the characteristics of and similarity between initial and subsequent pro-environmental behaviors can be expected to moderate predicted spillover effects. We explore the implications of our model for policymakers and practitioners, and suggest key areas where future research on the topic would be most beneficial.},

The spillover effect proposes that engaging in one behavior affects the probability of engagement or disengaging in a second behavior. Therefore, the positive spillover effect predicts that interventions targeting one specific behavioral have the capacity to promote non-targeted and/or future pro-environmental behaviors. However, the negative spillover effect predicts that engaging in a first pro-environmental behavior will prevent or decrease a second pro-environmental behavior. Since the theoretical and empirical basis for positive and negative spillover effects are not sufficiently understood, the present paper (1) suggests a distinction between behavioral, temporal, and contextual spillovers (2) reviews the existing spillover research literature across a variety of environmental domains, (3) presents potential moderators governing the direction of spillover effects, and finally (4) discuss techniques to promote pro-environmental spillovers.},

	abstract = {In response to agriculture's vulnerability and contribution to climate change, many governments are developing initiatives that promote the adoption of mitigation and adaptation practices among farmers. Since most climate policies affecting agriculture rely on voluntary efforts by individual farmers, success requires a sound understanding of the factors that motivate farmers to change practices. Recent evidence suggests that past experience with the effects of climate change and the psychological distance associated with people's concern for global and local impacts can influence environmental behavior. Here we surveyed farmers in a representative rural county in California's Central Valley to examine how their intention to adopt mitigation and adaptation practices is influenced by previous climate experiences and their global and local concerns about climate change. Perceived changes in water availability had significant effects on farmers' intention to adopt mitigation and adaptation strategies, which were mediated through global and local concerns respectively. This suggests that mitigation is largely motivated by psychologically distant concerns and beliefs about climate change, while adaptation is driven by psychologically proximate concerns for local impacts. This match between attitudes and behaviors according to the psychological distance at which they are cognitively construed indicates that policy and outreach initiatives may benefit by framing climate impacts and behavioral goals concordantly; either in a global context for mitigation or a local context for adaptation.},

	abstract = {Background and Objective: Currently, climate change represents an existential, physical and psychological, threat. Therefore, mitigation and adaptation actions and measures have become increasingly necessary to preserve individual and collective well-being. The psychological distance is one of the main psychological constructs that explains the most concrete or abstract perception of the objects and events surrounding people. The psychological distance is a multidimensional construct, and in accordance with the construal level theory ({CLT}), temporal, hypothetical, spatial, and social distance are considered the most critical dimensions. This systematic review aims to provide an update of the literature on the role of psychological distance in the commitment to engagement mitigation and adaptation attitudes towards climate change.Method: The review was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ({PRISMA}) framework. The data sources were {PubMed}, {PsycInfo}, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus databases.Results: Nineteen research articles were identified as eligible and relevant for the final synthesis. Results showed, in general, that individuals have a higher propensity to perform pro-environmental and resilient behaviors against climate change when it is perceived as more proximal and concrete within the construct of psychological distance. However, not all studies show this result. Some studies showed that, despite people considering climate changes as real and tangible, they do not perform mitigation and adaptation behaviors. Other studies showed that people implement these behaviors despite perceiving climate changes as distal and abstract.Conclusions: The current literature shows the existence of a link between psychological distance and pro-environmental and resilient behaviors applied to climate change. For a deeper understanding of the conflicting results that emerged, more studies are needed to investigate the possible presence of further psychological variables involved in the relationship between psychological distance, mitigation, and adaptation in environmental contexts.},

According to construal level theory, whether a phenomenon is perceived as psychologically distant or close is associated with whether it is construed as abstract or concrete, respectively. Previous work has established a link between psychological distance and climate action, but the associated role of construal level has yet to be explored in depth. In two representative surveys of Australians (N = 217 and N = 216), and one experiment (N = 319), we tested whether construal level and psychological distance from climate change predicted pro-environmental intentions and policy support, and whether manipulating distance and construal increased pro-environmental behaviours such as donations. Results showed that psychological closeness to climate change predicted more engagement in pro-environmental behaviours, while construal level produced inconsistent results, and manipulations of both variables failed to produce increases in pro-environmental behaviours. In contrast with the central tenet of construal level theory, construal level was unrelated to psychological distance in all three studies. Our findings suggest that the hypothesised relationship between construal level and psychological distance may not hold in the context of climate change, and that it may be difficult to change pro-environmental behaviour by manipulating these variables.},

There was evidence that participants with more pro-environmental attitudes who were reminded of frequent previous pro-environmental behaviour were less likely to seek information about their carbon footprint (consistent with a moral licensing effect) and that participants with less positive environmental attitudes who were reminded of infrequent previous pro-environmental behaviour were more likely to seek such information (consistent with to moral cleansing).

Yet, public response and personal behavior do not reflect the proportions of such a threat. In the present research we explored possible reasons for this discrepancy. Past research has shown that people perceive events as more threatening based on their immediacy, certainty, or personal implications. Liberman and Trope (2008) developed the concept of “psychological distance” ({PD}), according to which more immediate events are seen as “closer in time,” more certain events as “closer in probability,” and events with greater potential for personal harm as “socially closer.” Adopting this concept, we examined how distant, in terms of {PD}, people perceive environmental threats to be. Using a structural equations model, we measured how {PD} influences environmental threat perception. In a sample of 305 Israeli students who completed a computerized questionnaire, we found that environmental threats were perceived as psychologically distant in all of the {PD} dimensions, and that {PD} strongly affected perceived severity of environmental threats and willingness to engage in pro-environmental behavior. The reasons for the psychological remoteness of environmental threats and possible approaches to cope with its implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {It is widely assumed that psychological distance ({PD}) is a major barrier to climate action: many people are not motivated to act because they perceive climate change as affecting only remote locations in the far future. Reducing {PD} is considered an effective strategy to increase climate action. Yet, the idea of {PD} as a barrier to climate action has also been criticized. It currently remains unclear to what extent {PD} hinders climate action. In this review, based on a systematic examination of the literature, we show that there is little evidence to support the prominence of {PD}. Opinion polls show that most people actually perceive climate change as occurring now and close by. Seeing climate change as more distant does not necessarily result in less climate action, and reducing {PD} does not reliably increase climate action. Policymakers may develop ineffective climate action campaigns because of incorrect assumptions about {PD}. Our review highlights the importance of prioritizing evidence over intuition in policymaking to promote climate action.},

Technological improvements are also a vital tool for reducing environmental damage from consumption. However, their benefits are partially offset by the direct rebound effect, whereby a consumer rationally responds to an increase in resource use efficiency by consuming more. This paper investigates whether technological improvement might also reduce behaviorally motivated mitigation of environmental damage. A behavioral rebound effect operates through two channels. First, pro-environmental effort is reduced after a decrease in marginal environmental damage. Second, moral licensing reduces pro-environmental effort further when technological change is endogenous. I develop a novel real effort laboratory experiment to identify these behaviors. I find a positive behavioral rebound effect. I also find evidence consistent with moral licensing, which is strongest among subjects with a higher degree of pro-environmental attitudes and beliefs. Subjects’ baseline level of pro-environmental effort is driven by beliefs about social norms.},

	abstract = {Human activity is changing the biosphere in unprecedented ways, and addressing this challenge will require changes in individual and community patterns of behavior. One approach to managing individual behaviors is “top-down” and involves imposing sanctions through legislative frameworks. However, of itself, a top-down framework does not appear sufficient to encourage the changes required to meet environmental sustainability targets. Thus, there has been interest in changing individual-level behavior from the “bottom-up” by, for example, fostering desirable pro-environmental behaviors via social norms. Social norms arise from expectations about how others will behave and the consequences of conforming to or departing from them. Meta-analyses suggest that social norms can promote pro-environmental behavior. Environmental social norms that appear to have changed in recent decades and have themselves promoted change include recycling, include nascent behavioral shifts such as the move away from single-use plastics and flight shaming (flygskam). However, whether the conditions under which pro-environmental social norms emerge and are adhered to align with environmental systems’ features is unclear. Furthermore, individuals might feel powerless in a global system, which can limit the growth and influence of pro-environmental norms. We review the conditions believed to promote the development of and adherence to social norms, then consider how those conditions relate to the environmental challenges of the Anthropocene. While promoting social norms has a valuable role in promoting pro-environmental actions, we conclude that norms are most likely to be effective where individual actions are immediately evident and have an obvious and local effect.},

	abstract = {Studies on how one behavior affects subsequent behaviors find evidence for two opposite trends: Sometimes a first behavior increases the likelihood of engaging in additional behaviors that contribute to the same goal (positive behavioral spillover), and at other times a first behavior decreases this likelihood (negative spillover). A factor that may explain both patterns is attitude strength. A stronger (more favorable) attitude toward an issue may make the connections between related behaviors more salient and increase the motivation to work toward the underlying goal. We predicted that people with a stronger (more favorable) attitude are more likely to engage in subsequent behaviors that address an issue they care about. Two experiments tested the prediction in the contexts of pro-environmental and health behavior. Study 1 (N = 378) provided some support for the predicted moderating role of attitude toward the environment when participants recalled either an environmentally friendly or unfriendly action: A strong attitude increased the likelihood, whereas a weak attitude decreased the likelihood of carrying out successive goal-conducive behaviors. When compared to a neutral control condition in Study 2 (N = 929), participants with a weak environmental attitude supported pro-environmental petitions less strongly after an environmentally harmful action. Support for such petitions did not waver, however, among participants with a strong environmental attitude: They consistently acted environmentally friendly. Contrary to the hypothesis, in neither study did strength of attitude toward personal health moderate the effect of an initial behavior in the expected direction. In sum, the two studies provided only limited evidence for behavioral spillover: Participants mostly acted in accordance with their attitude but were hardly affected by recalling previous actions. When behavioral spillover did occur, however, a strong environmental attitude tended to increase the likelihood of acting in an environmentally friendly way, whereas the behavior of those with a weak attitude was less predictable. This research contributes to a more nuanced theoretical understanding of the role of attitude in spillover, but provides only limited evidence for its role as a moderator.},

This study explores how choosing a green product influences subsequent pro-environmental product preference. Drawing on the self-perception and moral licensing research, we find that past green product consumption can yield two conflicting mechanisms: environmental self-perception (the green spillover effect) and perceived goal progress (the green licensing effect). Given these two conflicting mechanisms, past pro-environmental product selection subsequently either reinforces or undermines subsequent pro-environmental product purchase preference. This study finds that these effects are contingent on the pre-existing moral identities of individual consumers. Among consumers with high moral identity internalization or low moral identity symbolization, pro-environmental product purchase preference is reinforced, whereas consumers with low moral identity internalization or high moral identity symbolization show less preference for pro-environmental products after prior green consumption. Overall, these findings provide new insight into pro-environmental product consumption and moral identity.},

To test this, we employed an experimental task in which participants were presented with multiple climate change scenarios and asked to update their beliefs after receiving scientific evidence. Additionally, we investigated whether biased belief updating and {PEB} could be altered by brief experimental interventions providing information on different aspects of climate change. Results show that optimistically biased belief updating did not predict {PEB} cross-sectionally, but did predict {PEB} 4 weeks later, while controlling for baseline levels of {PEB}. The experimental interventions did not significantly alter belief updating or increase {PEB}, although there were significant gender differences. The results suggest that an optimistic bias in belief updating longitudinally predicts low engagement in {PEB}, possibly because selectively integrating good news over bad news reduces the perceived urgency to take action. Yet the effect may be small and detectable only in sufficiently large samples. The results also indicate that it is challenging to modify this bias. Implications for research on attitude change, social cognition and {PEB} are discussed.},

It develops a systems-thinking framework to analyse dynamic feedback loops influencing flood risk management support over time. The survey data collection overlapped with a severe storm event in Central Europe, the storm “Adrian” (also known as “Vaia”). This provided a unique pre- and post-event perspective. Results highlight the critical role of individual knowledge, trust in authorities, and social group dynamics in shaping risk perception processes. The study shows how major weather events can change perceptions, sense of safety, and institutional trust within local communities, and more interestingly, these changes can vary spatially. The findings are summarised using a systems-thinking framework, which helps to identify possible feedback loops between flood risk management interventions and long-term public support. The study emphasizes the importance of forward-looking, systems-thinking approaches in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of flood risk management plans. These approaches allow one to account for often-overlooked dynamics, such as spatially varying feedback loops and counter-intuitive effects, ultimately improving the long-term effectiveness of flood risk management.},

However, the link between perception of baseline states and support for conservation planning has not been tested empirically. Here, we investigate how perceptions of change in coral reef ecosystems affect stakeholders’ willingness to pay ({WTP}) for the establishment of protected areas. Coral reefs are experiencing rapid, global change that is observable by the public, and therefore are an ideal ecosystem to test links between beliefs about baseline states and willingness to support conservation. We find that respondents perceived change to coral reef communities across six variables: coral abundance, fish abundance, fish diversity, fish size, sedimentation, and water pollution. Residents who accurately perceived declines in reef health had significantly higher {WTP} for protected areas ({US} \$256.80 vs. \$102.50 per year), suggesting that shifted historical baselines reduce engagement with conservation efforts. If {WTP} translates to engagement, this suggests that goals for restoration and recovery are likely to be more ambitious if the public is aware of long term change. Therefore, communicating the scope and depth of environmental problems is essential in engaging the public in conservation.},

Yet societal as well as scientific perceptions of these baselines are often based on ecosystems that have been deeply transformed by human actions. Despite increased awareness about the pervasiveness and implications of this shifting baseline syndrome, ongoing global assessments of the state of biodiversity do not take into account the long-term, cumulative, anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity. Here, we propose a new framework for documenting such impacts, by classifying populations according to the extent to which they deviate from a baseline in the absence of human actions. We apply this framework to the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) to illustrate how it can be used to assess populations with different geographies and timelines of known or suspected impacts. Through other examples, we discuss how the framework can be applied to populations for which there is a wide diversity of existing knowledge, by making the best use of the available ecological, historical and archaeological data. Combined across multiple populations, this framework provides a standard for assessing cumulative anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity.

	abstract = {A growing body of scholarship argues that collective memories of historical environmental change—formed and transmitted through museums, movies, novels, activist performances and other cultural texts and practices—can help nurture proenvironmentalism. Three possible mechanisms have been proposed: the shifting baseline syndrome, planetary memory and ecological grief. My paper adds a further mechanism to this list: national identity. Through a case study of public memory in Aotearoa New Zealand, the paper demonstrates that culturally mediated representations of the historical past play an important role in the construction of environmentally responsible national identities. Whereas narrating the history of Aotearoa New Zealand exclusively from the viewpoint of European colonial settlers supports a monocultural construct of national identity that sanctions the exploitation of nature for human ends, representations of the past that are inclusive of Indigenous Māori experiences generate a bicultural image of the nation that engenders greater care for the environment. The paper develops this argument by means of a mixed-method research design that combines quantitative mediation analyses of original survey data from a national probability sample (N = 1066) with qualitative interrogations of two museum exhibits (the National Museum of Sheep and Shearing and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa).},

	abstract = {Are people more inclined to adapt to climate change if they believe that climate change is real, caused by human behavior, and/or brings negative consequences? Previous studies provided inconclusive results on the relationship between climate change perceptions and adaptation behavior. Using a longitudinal approach, we examined whether risk perception, self‐efficacy, and outcome efficacy play a role in how and when climate change perceptions are associated with adaptation to pluvial flooding and heat stress in the Netherlands. As expected, stronger climate change perceptions were associated with stronger perceptions of climate‐related risks, which in turn lead to stronger intentions to implement adaptation measures. Yet, neither climate change perceptions nor risk perception were associated with whether people had actually implemented adaptation measures during a 1‐year period. Contrary to common assumptions in the literature, higher levels of perceived self‐efficacy and outcome efficacy did not strengthen the relations between climate change perceptions and adaptation intentions and behavior. Rather, higher levels of self‐efficacy and outcome efficacy were directly related to stronger intentions to take adaptive measures and taking those measures within a period of 1 year. Exploratory analyses offered initial support for a sequential model where climate change perceptions lead to higher levels of perceptions of specific climate‐related risks, which in turn lead to stronger self‐efficacy and outcome efficacy, ultimately increasing adaptation intentions, but not actual behavior. Strategies to promote adaptation behavior could aim to remove behavioral barriers to increase self‐efficacy, and strengthen outcome efficacy, enabling people to act on their climate change perceptions.},

This phenomenon, known as shifting baseline syndrome ({SBS}), is increasingly recognized as a likely major obstacle to addressing global environmental challenges. However, the prevalence of {SBS} remains uncertain. We conducted an extensive systematic review, synthesizing existing research on people's perceived environmental baselines. Our analysis, based on 73 case studies, suggests that {SBS} is a widespread global phenomenon, occurring across diverse socioeconomic, environmental, and cultural settings. We observed that younger individuals tend to hold lower environmental baselines across various environmental contexts, including climate change, natural resource depletion, biodiversity loss, and pollution. An upward shift in perceived environmental baselines among younger generations was rarely observed. These results underscore the challenge that {SBS} poses when policy and management responses to environmental degradation are influenced by perceived natural environmental norms.},

	abstract = {Feedbacks between people and ecosystems are central to the study of social–ecological systems ({SES}) but remain poorly understood. It is commonly assumed that changes in ecosystems leading to a reduction in ecosystem services will trigger human responses that seek to restore service provision. Other responses are possible, however, but remain less studied. We evaluated the effect of environmental change, specifically the degradation of coral reefs, on the supply of and demand for a cultural ecosystem service ({CES}); that is, recreation. We found that declines in coral cover reduced demand for recreational ecosystem services but had no apparent effect on the benefits received from recreation. While this finding seems counter-intuitive given previous experimental data that suggest ecosystem quality affects people's satisfaction, our analysis suggests that social adaptation could have mediated the anticipated negative impact of environmental change on {CES} benefits. We propose four mechanisms that may explain this effect and that require further research: spatial diversification; (service) substitution; shifting baselines; and time-delayed effects. Our findings emphasize the importance of human culture and perception as influences on human responses to environmental change, and the relevance of the more subjective elements of social systems for understanding social–ecological feedbacks.

	abstract = {The changing global climate is producing increasingly unusual weather relative to preindustrial conditions. In an absolute sense, these changing conditions constitute direct evidence of anthropogenic climate change. However, human evaluation of weather as either normal or abnormal will also be influenced by a range of factors including expectations, memory limitations, and cognitive biases. Here we show that experience of weather in recent years?rather than longer historical periods?determines the climatic baseline against which current weather is evaluated, potentially obscuring public recognition of anthropogenic climate change. We employ variation in decadal trends in temperature at weekly and county resolution over the continental United States, combined with discussion of the weather drawn from over 2 billion social media posts. These data indicate that the remarkability of particular temperatures changes rapidly with repeated exposure. Using sentiment analysis tools, we provide evidence for a ?boiling frog? effect: The declining noteworthiness of historically extreme temperatures is not accompanied by a decline in the negative sentiment that they induce, indicating that social normalization of extreme conditions rather than adaptation is driving these results. Using climate model projections we show that, despite large increases in absolute temperature, anomalies relative to our empirically estimated shifting baseline are small and not clearly distinguishable from zero throughout the 21st century.},

The use of agent-based modeling and simulation ({ABMS}) to explore these behaviors is increasing in diverse research fields. This paper provides a systematic mapping study to analyze how {ABMS} has been applied to analyze {PEBs}. Fifty-six articles published between 2009 and 2021 from different knowledge areas are examined, reviewing each model for similarities and particularities. {ABMS} is a potential tool for simulating future scenarios to comprehend {PEBs}, especially in situations that cannot be empirically measured. The studies were investigated considering the behavioral theories, {ABMS} platform or computer language, simulation characteristics and features, computational model code transparency, and validation employed. Most reviewed studies focused on electric energy consumption or technologies to reduce future demand. However, other subjects, such as waste prevention, consumption, eating habits, and water use, still need to be explored. The theory of planned behavior ({TPB}) and social norms were the most prevalent behavioral theory and behavioral influence bases to simulate individuals. Still, many other behavioral assumptions are being implemented. Future research should analyze understudied {PEBs} using {ABMS} to support the simulation of more realistic scenarios in developing and underdeveloped countries. The conclusion shows the need for more detailed criteria descriptions to understand and replicate these models and how ethics can be an important feature for future {ABMS} experiments.},

Then, I chart the crucial role that tipping points played in creating the modern Earth system. Looking ahead, potential largescale tipping points are brieﬂy reviewed before highlighting systems that could harbor tipping points across mechanisms and scales. The prospects for anticipating tipping points, avoiding dangerous ones, and encouraging others are outlined.

This review focuses on human drivers of tipping events in coupled human–environment systems where changes to the human system can abruptly lead to desirable or undesirable new human–environment states. We use snowball sampling from relevant search terms to review the modeling of social processes – such as social norms and rates of social change – that are shown to drive tipping events, ﬁnding that many affect the coupled system depending on the system type and initial conditions. For example, tipping points can manifest very differently in human extraction versus human emission systems. Some potential interventions, such as reducing costs associated with sustainable behavior, have intuitive results. However, their beneﬁcial outcomes via less obvious tipping events are highlighted. Of the models reviewed, we found that greater structural complexity can be associated with increased potential for tipping events. We review generic and state-of-the-art techniques in early warning signals of tipping events and identify signiﬁcant opportunities to utilize digital social data to look for such signals.

Many individuals change their behavior to adapt to a dynamically changing environment by following simple rules of behavior and interacting with information from neighboring individuals. In this study, the traditional public goods game model is improved by combining the advantages of game theory and interactive learning. A strategy adaptive evolution method based on a public goods game is proposed. The emergence of cooperative behavior in weighted networks under the co-evolution of game strategies and node weights is explored in conjunction with multi-agent interactive learning. The results show that in a public goods game with strategic adaptation, a person’s inﬂuence becomes greater if their level of adaptation exceeds the desired level, and less otherwise. This weight adjustment is deﬁned by the intensity parameter δ. A moderate δ value can effectively facilitate the occurrence of cooperative evolution. The level of cooperation depends mainly on the weight distribution of participants, which leads to the formation of cooperative clusters controlled by high-weighted cooperators. Even with the great temptation to defect, these cooperators can prevail over defectors. The adjustment of node weights increases the heterogeneity of individuals. This research provides a viable pathway to solve social dilemmas and will further promote the application of multi-agent intelligent decision making.},

In this paper we explore an alternative approach in which the policy is explicitly represented by its own function approximator, independent of the value function, and is updated according to the gradient of expected reward with respect to the policy parameters. Williams's {REINFORCE} method and actor-critic methods are examples of this approach. Our main new result is to show that the gradient can be written in a form suitable for estimation from experience aided by an approximate action-value or advantage function. Using this result, we prove for the first time that a version of policy iteration with arbitrary differentiable function approximation is convergent to a locally optimal policy.},

Aiming at the optimization goal of effective handover ratio, this paper proposes a deep Q-learning ({DQN}) method that dynamically selects handover parameters according to wireless signal fading conditions. This approach seeks good backward compatibility. In order to enhance the efﬁciency and performance of the {DQN} method, Long Short Term Memory ({LSTM}) is used to build a digital twin and assist the {DQN} algorithm to achieve a more efﬁcient search. Simulation experiments prove that the enhanced method has a faster convergence speed than the ordinary {DQN} method, and at the same time, achieves an average effective handover ratio increase of 2.7\%. Moreover, in different wireless signal fading intervals, the method proposed in this paper has achieved better performance.},

We prove that this augmentation results in a stronger notion of convergence than the basic gradient ascent, that is, strategies converge to a Nash equilibrium within a restricted class of iterated games. Motivated by this augmentation, we then propose a new practical multi-agent reinforcement learning ({MARL}) algorithm exploiting approximate policy prediction. Empirical results show that it converges faster and in a wider variety of situations than state-of-the-art {MARL} algorithms.},

	abstract = {Mathematical models that couple human behavior to environmental processes can offer valuable insights into how human behavior affects various types of ecological, climate, and epidemiological systems. This review focuses on human drivers of tipping events in coupled human–environment systems where changes to the human system can abruptly lead to desirable or undesirable new human–environment states. We use snowball sampling from relevant search terms to review the modeling of social processes – such as social norms and rates of social change – that are shown to drive tipping events, finding that many affect the coupled system depending on the system type and initial conditions. For example, tipping points can manifest very differently in human extraction versus human emission systems. Some potential interventions, such as reducing costs associated with sustainable behavior, have intuitive results. However, their beneficial outcomes via less obvious tipping events are highlighted. Of the models reviewed, we found that greater structural complexity can be associated with increased potential for tipping events. We review generic and state-of-the-art techniques in early warning signals of tipping events and identify significant opportunities to utilize digital social data to look for such signals. We conclude with an outline of challenges and promising future directions specific to furthering our understanding and informing policy that promotes sustainability within coupled human–environment systems. 

 Non-technical summary. Mathematical models that include interactions between humans and the environment can provide valuable information to further our understanding of tipping points. Many social processes such as social norms and rates of social change can affect these tipping points in ways that are often specific to the system being modeled. Higher complexity of social structure can increase the likelihood of these transitions. We discuss how data are used to predict tipping events across many coupled systems.},

	abstract = {Variance-based approaches are widely used for Global Sensitivity Analysis ({GSA}) of environmental models. However, methods that consider the entire Probability Density Function ({PDF}) of the model output, rather than its variance only, are preferable in cases where variance is not an adequate proxy of uncertainty, e.g. when the output distribution is highly-skewed or when it is multi-modal. Still, the adoption of density-based methods has been limited so far, possibly because they are relatively more difficult to implement. Here we present a novel {GSA} method, called {PAWN}, to efficiently compute density-based sensitivity indices. The key idea is to characterise output distributions by their Cumulative Distribution Functions ({CDF}), which are easier to derive than {PDFs}. We discuss and demonstrate the advantages of {PAWN} through applications to numerical and environmental modelling examples. We expect {PAWN} to increase the application of density-based approaches and to be a complementary approach to variance-based {GSA}.},

	abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, Ajzen, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.},

Together, these examples illustrate the role of external forces in reshaping the systems in question and their vulnerability to environmental hazards, as well as the different capacities of stakeholders, based on their access to social and biophysical capital, to respond to the changes and hazards. The framework proves useful in directing attention to the interacting parts of the coupled system and helps identify gaps in information and understanding relevant to reducing vulnerability in the systems as a whole.},

	abstract = {Humans and the environment form a single complex system where humans not only influence ecosystems but also react to them. Despite this, there are far fewer coupled human–environment system ({CHES}) mathematical models than models of uncoupled ecosystems. We argue that these coupled models are essential to understand the impacts of social interventions and their potential to avoid catastrophic environmental events and support sustainable trajectories on multi-decadal timescales. A brief history of {CHES} modelling is presented, followed by a review spanning recent {CHES} models of systems including forests and land use, coral reefs and fishing and climate change mitigation. The ability of {CHES} modelling to capture dynamic two-way feedback confers advantages, such as the ability to represent ecosystem dynamics more realistically at longer timescales, and allowing insights that cannot be generated using ecological models. We discuss examples of such key insights from recent research. However, this strength brings with it challenges of model complexity and tractability, and the need for appropriate data to parameterize and validate {CHES} models. Finally, we suggest opportunities for {CHES} models to improve human–environment sustainability in future research spanning topics such as natural disturbances, social structure, social media data, model discovery and early warning signals.

	abstract = {In complex systems, a critical transition is a shift in a system’s dynamical regime from its current state to a strongly contrasting state as external conditions move beyond a tipping point. These transitions are often preceded by characteristic early warning signals such as increased system variability. However, early warning signals in complex, coupled human–environment systems ({HESs}) remain little studied. Here, we compare critical transitions and their early warning signals in a coupled {HES} model to an equivalent environment model uncoupled from the human system. We parameterize the {HES} model, using social and ecological data from old-growth forests in Oregon. We find that the coupled {HES} exhibits a richer variety of dynamics and regime shifts than the uncoupled environment system. Moreover, the early warning signals in the coupled {HES} can be ambiguous, heralding either an era of ecosystem conservationism or collapse of both forest ecosystems and conservationism. The presence of human feedback in the coupled {HES} can also mitigate the early warning signal, making it more difficult to detect the oncoming regime shift. We furthermore show how the coupled {HES} can be “doomed to criticality”: Strategic human interactions cause the system to remain perpetually in the vicinity of a collapse threshold, as humans become complacent when the resource seems protected but respond rapidly when it is under immediate threat. We conclude that the opportunities, benefits, and challenges of modeling regime shifts and early warning signals in coupled {HESs} merit further research.},
